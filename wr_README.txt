This README is for Windward Studios developers.

The module is in restfulengine.py.  This is what you distribute, and this is
what you import.

This Python module uses:
* Requests for the HTTP requests
    http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
    $ pip install requests
* py.test for testing
    http://pytest.org/latest/
    $ pip install pytest
* Sphinx for documentation
    http://sphinx-doc.org/
    $ pip install sphinx


=======
TESTING
=======
Tests are in tests/test_pythonclient.py. They use py.test. Once before running,
you must run the following:

    $ pip install -e .

From the project's top level directory (PythonClient).  To run the tests, run

    $ py.test

which will collect all the tests and run them.  These tests do expect a
RESTfulEngine instance running on port 49731 on localhost.  More info on
pytest can be found on the py.test website at pytest.org.  The tests mimic
the original tests in the CSharp client.


=============
DOCUMENTATION
=============
To generate documentation from the source files, run:

    $ make html


=================
PyPI distribution
=================
See http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html

a .pypirc file.

To upload documentation, go to edit the package at:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=pkg_edit&name=restfulengine
